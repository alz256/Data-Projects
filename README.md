Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
This project was completed by Allen Zhou in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others--including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof-- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description: 
The project examines home court advantage among NBA franchises using the elo system which 538 uses, as well as data from their Github repository which is public access.
The method is to examine each teams relative elo compared to their opponents in home court wins to determine if there is a high percentage of wins on home court. 
Additionally, the project will attempt to identify the teams with the best home court advantage through looking at home versus away wins when at a disadvantage and other factors. 
Finally, there will be a conclusion listing which teams have the best home court advantage and attempts to explain why using observational data, as well as provide additional lines for future inquiry.
